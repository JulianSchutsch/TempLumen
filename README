Welcome to Lumen!

Lumen is (or will be someday) a GUI toolkit for Ada.

It is written entirely in Ada (with a few insignificant exceptions,
like in the Linux joystick code, no direct calling of ioctl from Ada
yet), based on OpenGL and thus portable between Unix/X11 and MS-Windows/Win32.
It is expected to be portable to Macs once somebody steps up and writes
the low-level portions for OS-X.

The root of the documentation source is "doc/index.markdown".  The
formatted docs should be available here:

Enjoy, and visit the public git repository at either of these two places:

   git://ftp.niestu.com/lumen
